Digital

I want a new world without the order
I wanna resurrect and live a little shorter
I wanna it heavy, I want the fury
I wanna be like the judge and jury

From the outside everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside
From the outside everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside

We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change
We just wanna change everything

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital, digital
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital heartbeat
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Digital, digital
We don't wanna change
We just wanna change everything

I want a new world without the order
I wanna resurrect and live a little shorter
I wanna it heavy, I want the fury
I wanna be like the judge and jury

From the outside everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside
From the outside everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside

We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change
We just wanna change everything

Eh, eh, eh, eh
